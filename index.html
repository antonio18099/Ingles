                    <p class="p-p">Hello, I'm Antonio. I'm 18 years old and currently a student at SENA, where I am pursuing my passion for learning and personal growth. Alongside my studies, I work in a restaurant a few days a week, which gives me the opportunity to develop my skills in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.</p>
                    <p  class="p-p">Music, video games, and the company of amazing people are some of the things I cherish the most. Music is a constant companion in my life, whether I'm relaxing at home or commuting to work. I also have a deep love for video games, which provide a great way to unwind and connect with friends. Additionally, I appreciate spending time with wonderful people, enjoying their company and creating meaningful memories together.</p>
                    <h4 class="h3">hobbies</h4>
                    <p class="p-p">I have a variety of hobbies that keep me entertained and engaged. I love playing video games, as they provide an immersive experience and a fun way to connect with friends. Listening to music is another passion of mine, as it helps me relax and lifts my spirits.</p>
                    <p class="p-p">I also enjoy going for walks, especially in nature. There’s something incredibly peaceful about being outdoors, surrounded by the beauty of the natural world. Whether it's a hike in the mountains or a stroll in the park, I always feel rejuvenated after spending time outside.</p>

            <div class="project-content">
                <p class="p-p">I chose this program because, ever since I was little, everything related to computers and technology has always caught my attention. I remember spending hours disassembling old electronic devices to understand their workings, which led me to self-learn about programming, hardware, and networks. My passion for technology has grown over time, and I am convinced that formal education in this field is the next logical step to achieve my professional goals.</p>
                <p class="o-p">ADSO, which stands for "Analysis and Development of Information Systems," is a program designed to train professionals in the field of information technology. We learn to analyze, design, develop, and implement information systems using various programming languages and technologies. In ADSO, I focus on acquiring skills in programming, systems analysis, and project management, participating in both theoretical and practical classes, and working on real projects that apply this knowledge.</p>
